Summary-
# INTRODUCTION-
Soft heap is a simple varient of priority queue.It supports insert, meld, minckey, delete and inorder traversal operations.It consists of linked list of trees. 
Each tree consists of node containing ckey value,rank and it's left and right pointers pointing to it's left and right child node.Each node has a linked list
which contains key less than or equal to node's ckey value .The size of linked list is constraint by fixed softsize.Each tree is heap ordered with respect to
ckey values of nodes such that ckey(of node)<=ckey(of left child) & ckey(of node)<=ckey(of left child) if exist.If tree rank is z then it's left and right
child if exists will have rank z-1.
